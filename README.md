Purpose: Class Project

What is this project about?
    This is a random quote generator. The user can go on the website and start to browse some random quotes. In addition, the user has the ability to share tweet these quotes right from the website.

Skills rainforced by this project:

1. DOM and DOM manipulation:
The use of javaScript to change web content dynamically. For this project, it wasn't just about showing different random quotes; but also, changing the background after every 60 seconds (TO BE IMPLIMENTED: In my javaScript file, I would have an array of background URLs. Then, I would write a function that finds the next background. First, the function has to grab the body element from html and store in a variable called "body". Then loop through the array of backgrounds and set the body.style background to each background after specified seconds). 

2. Ability to fetch data from an API
Programming is not just about writing code from scratch; sometimes, we have to leverage an existing code or data to build our own. I was able to make use of Hero Patterns's beautiful background images. https://www.heropatterns.com.

I also took advantage of Google Fonts, a collection of fonts and icons which are free and open source. 

With the help of these awesome APIs, I was able to channel all my effort to the logic of my project.


What can I do better on this project?

1. First, I have to fix my try and catch function. Currently, it's based on the assumption that nothing goes wrong. However, we need to fix the catch function, in case something goes wrong on my code.
